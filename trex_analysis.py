### Kits that willl be helpful - Data, View, Join, Filter, ColumnOp, DataframePivot
### The focus of this challenge is join tables, filtering the joined table,
###    doing an operation, and summarizing a statistic

## We will determine which region provides the cuddly T-Rex
##    with the most meat per minute, on average, during a hunt!


# Load the trex_profiles.csv

# Load the feeding_events.csv

# Join the tables on the T-Rex's name

# We only want to look at events where the hunt was a success

# Compute the amount of meat captured from a hunt per minute of hunting

# Pivot the data to see the average of the previously computed value per territory

# Submit the territory that provides the maximum average of the computed meat per minute
